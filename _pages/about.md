Hello! I am a first year CS PhD student at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu">University of Southern California</a>, advised by <a href="https://swabhs.com">Swabha Swayamdipta</a>, and a member of <a href="https://nlp.usc.edu">USC NLP Group</a> and <a href="https://dill-lab.github.io">DILL Lab</a>. Currently, I am a visiting student researcher at <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/special-year-large-language-models-transformers-part-2">UC Berkeley -- Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing</a>.

My current research focuses on <strong>theoretical & empirical understanding of language models</strong>. Specifically, I am interested in:
- Building a principled understanding of when & why they work / fail.
- Understanding the science behind their scaling & generalization capabilities.
- Exploring avenues for improving their reliability & trustworthiness.

<!-- My [research](./research) lie at the intersection of machine learning & natural language processing, with a particular focus on <strong>Robust, Generalizable, & Trustworthy NLP</strong>. More recently, I have been interested in <strong>uncertainty quantification</strong> and <strong>evaluating robustness of langauge models</strong>.  -->

I recently graduated with a <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/mlt.html">Masters in Language Technologies (MLT)</a> from <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> -- <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/">Language Technologies Institute</a>, where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/">Barnabás Póczos</a> & <a href="http://www.phontron.com">Graham Neubig</a>. During my masters, I interned at <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com">Apple</a> twice (summer '23 & '24) with the Siri & Information Intelligence group. 
<!-- I worked on hallucination evaluation & synthetic data generation, both in the context of LLMs. -->

Before coming to CMU, I was a Predoctoral Researcher (Research Associate) at the <a href="https://www.lcs2.in/">Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2), IIIT Delhi</a>.
 <!-- where I worked on various research projects on multimodal machine learning, social computing, & dialog systems. -->
 Even before that, I graduated with a Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Science from <a href="https://http://www.unipune.ac.in">Savitribai Phule Pune University</a>.


<!-- <strong>Outreach</strong> --  -->
I'm eager to connect with my academic peers! If our research interests align (or diverge) in intriguing ways, I'd be delighted to explore potential collaborations or simply exchange ideas! 
<!-- Additionally, I'm also looking for <strong>research internship opportunities for summer 2025</strong>. Please feel free to reach out, if there is a good fit! -->

I am also a strong advocate for diversity and mentorship in computer science research. If you’d like to chat about navigating ML/NLP research, grad school applications, or want to collaborate on a research project, please visit the [Outreach & Mentorship](./outreach) tab for more information.

<!-- My research has been published at top NLP/ML venues such as <strong>TMLR, ACL, EMNLP, EACL, SIGKDD, & IJCAI</strong>.  -->
<!-- You can learn more about my publications [here](./publications). You can find my <strong>detailed CV [here](./assets/pdf/Atharva_Kulkarni_CV_detailed.pdf)</strong>. -->
