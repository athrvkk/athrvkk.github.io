# Outreach 

I have been incredibly fortunate to receive invaluable advice from various friends and colleagues at CMU, including <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ggFzw0MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Lucio Dery</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i7V1kJgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra">Amrith Setlur</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yInhszwAAAAJ&hl=en">Simran Khanuja</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G1Jw4CYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Amanda Bertsch</a>, amongst others, who have mentored me in my research projects and grad school applications. Now that I'm a PhD student, I am committed to giving back to the academic community. I would be thrilled to support and mentor aspiring researchers, especially those from underrepresented communities.


You can book a meeting slot in my outreach office hours [here](https://calendar.app.google/Ekko2kLsNFxgMQKe8).

## Research Mentorship / Collaboration

It is great to hear that you are interested in doing ML research! If you’re interested in my research or have project ideas related to 
- The science of Foundation models
- Understanding their failure modes, limitations, & geometric properties
- Making them more robust & generalizable

Then please feel free to email/slack me. I’d be glad to discuss your interests and explore any potential opportunities! 

<!-- As someone who is passionate about both conducting research and mentoring, I understand how valuable time and effort are for both mentors and mentees. To ensure a good fit for both of us, I would appreciate it if you could complete a demonstration of interest. This small demo project or write-up will help us get a sense of our potential collaboration. Your demo might include:

- A high-level project proposal that outlines the objectives, methodology, and rationale.
- A hypothesis or mathematical idea aimed at enhancing our understanding of language or language modeling.
- Results from an initial experiment, along with an interpretation and suggestions for future steps. -->

## Grad School Mentorship
I am always excited to help prospective students with grad school applications (research-based MS and PhD programs in ML/NLP). Please note that my expertise is primarily in  (particularly in ML and NLP). Feel free to reach out with any questions, and I'll do my best to help!

Before reaching out to me, please take a look at these excellent resources compiled by various talented students. I found them to be immensely helpful during my MS/PhD applications.
