# Current Research Projects / Interersts 

Foundation models have heralded a new era in modern machine learning. They are trained on massive raw data at scale and work well on a wide range of tasks with little to no fine-tuning. My research focuses on: 
- Building a principled understanding of when and why they work or fail.
- The science behind their generalization capabilities.
- Avenues for improving their reliability and trustworthiness.
